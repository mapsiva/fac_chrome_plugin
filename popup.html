    We would like to invite you to participate in our study, which revolves around the evaluation of the transparency of the Facebook ad ecosystem, as well as the level of control it provides to the users.

  <div class="row">
  <small>We are asking you to participate in this study because you have a Facebook account. Your decision to participate in this research project is voluntary. You do not have to participate and you can refuse to participate. Even if you start using our application, you can opt out at any time.

      <div class="row">

      <small>The risk to you, as a participant, is minimal.  We are going to collect your Facebok id, the ads you receive, the explanations that Facebook provides to you, and periodically, your ad preferences page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences">https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences</a>). Moreover, we might target you with some ads, and consequently, collect their explanations.

       <div class="row">
 
       <small>We will keep this data on a private research server, and no one other than active research team members will be able to view the data. The primary risk here is that you may not wish to make such data public (for example, you may not wish others to know what ads you are receiving). We will therefore anonymize all of your data after the project is completed, and will only archive anonymized data; we will delete all the non-anonymized data once the experiment is done. All personally identifiable information (names, Facebook IDs, email addresses) will not be recoverable from our anonymized data.
